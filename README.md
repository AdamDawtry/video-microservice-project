# video-microservice-project
Simplified implementation of a site meant to host videos, to be deployed in a Docker container. The project is built in Java using a microservice architecture, Kafka for communication between microservices, and MariaDB and SQL for database queries.

The modelling folder contains files for generating model and metamodel diagrams using Eclipse Sirius, for which documentation can be found [here](https://eclipse.dev/sirius/getstarted.html).

microservices contains most of the actual functionality of the app, with the following key directories:
- **client** is the application used by the mock "user" of the app to interact with the app's features 
- **sql** contains the databases generated by the microservices
- **video-microservice** is the component which allows users to be created as well as publish, like/dislike and view videos, among other things
- **subscription-microservice** maintains relationships between users and their subscribed topics, which include other users or specific video tags
- **trending-microservice** allows a user to fetch the most popular videos from the last hour in a rolling time window based on likes
